Powerline Stereo 3D Reconstruction & UAV Path Planning System
1. 3d_demo: Stereo 3D Reconstruction of Power Lines
Input

left_mask.png

right_mask.png

Output

pts_cam.txt — 3D points in camera frame

pts_body.txt — 3D points in UAV body frame

waypoints.json — generated by the path-planning module

Functionality

Skeleton extraction

Connected-component grouping

Row-wise feature matching

Disparity computation

Stereo triangulation

Camera → body coordinate transformation

2. demo_0: Stereo Correspondence Visualization

Displays line-to-line matches between left and right masks with connecting lines.

3. demo_1: Matched and Unmatched Point Visualization

Highlights:

Matched points (yellow)

Unmatched points (red)

Line correspondences

Useful for debugging segmentation gaps, occlusion, or matching failures.

. UAV_waypoints: Automatic UAV Path Generation

This module generates a safe inspection trajectory from 3D point clouds.

Key Features

Read stereo masks

Reconstruct 3D point cloud using simple_pipeline_from_masks

Fit a B-spline curve to the powerline

Compute curvature

Determine safe lateral offset

Generate UAV waypoints along the curve

Visualize 3D line + offset path

Output uav_waypoints.json

Parameter Explanation
base_min (Minimum Safety Distance)

Industry-standard 10–30 m depending on voltage level and regulations.

alpha (Curvature Weight)

Larger curvature → larger lateral offset for safety.

Offset Direction

Default: +Y in body frame (right-hand side of the powerline).
To move left: set offset to negative.

5. MAVLink / ROS Waypoints Module

Converts uav_waypoints.json into:

MAVLink mission (PX4 / ArduPilot)
